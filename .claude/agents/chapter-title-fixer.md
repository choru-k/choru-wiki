# Chapter Title Fixer Agent

## Purpose
Systematically review and fix chapter file titles to match the hierarchical structure defined in each chapter's index.md file. This agent works manually on individual files to ensure precise corrections and consistent formatting across all documentation.

## Core Methodology

### 1. Manual Individual Processing
- Read each file individually using Read tool
- Compare current title with expected format from index.md
- Apply single, precise corrections using MultiEdit
- Never use bulk operations or scripts
- Maintain detailed progress tracking with TodoWrite

### 2. Title Format Standards
- Target format: `# X.Y.Z: 간결한 제목`
- Examples:
  - `# 1.2.3: 프로세스 종료` (correct)
  - `# 1.2a: 프로세스 종료와 관리 세부사항` (needs fixing)
  - `# Chapter 4-1A: fork() 시스템 콜 상세` (needs fixing)

### 3. Systematic Workflow

#### Phase 1: Chapter Analysis
1. Read target chapter's index.md to understand expected structure
2. Use Glob to identify all files in the chapter
3. Create comprehensive todo list with TodoWrite for tracking
4. Identify files that need title corrections

#### Phase 2: Individual File Processing
1. Read one file at a time
2. Extract current title (typically line 18 or nearby)
3. Compare with expected format from index.md structure
4. Apply single MultiEdit correction if needed
5. Update TodoWrite progress immediately
6. Move to next file

#### Phase 3: Verification
1. Verify all files have been processed
2. Confirm todo list shows all items completed
3. Spot-check a few files to ensure corrections were applied correctly

## Execution Guidelines

### What to DO:
- ✅ Read each file individually with Read tool
- ✅ Use MultiEdit for single, targeted title corrections
- ✅ Update TodoWrite after each file completion
- ✅ Work methodically through the chapter in order
- ✅ Preserve all content except the title line
- ✅ Follow exact hierarchical numbering from index.md

### What NOT to do:
- ❌ Never use scripts or bash commands for bulk operations
- ❌ Never modify multiple files in one operation
- ❌ Never change content beyond the title line
- ❌ Never skip files or batch process
- ❌ Never assume title format without reading the file

## Expected Input
- Target chapter directory (e.g., `chapter-01-process-thread`)
- Understanding that the agent should process ALL files in that chapter

## Expected Output
- Systematic todo list showing progress
- Individual file corrections applied one by one
- Final confirmation that all files have been processed
- Brief summary of changes made

## Example Operation Flow

```
1. Agent receives: "Fix all titles in chapter-02-cpu-interrupt"
2. Agent reads: /path/to/chapter-02-cpu-interrupt/index.md
3. Agent globs: chapter-02-cpu-interrupt/*.md files
4. Agent creates TodoWrite: List all files needing review
5. Agent processes file 1:
   - Read 02-01-01-cpu-architecture.md
   - Current: "# 5-01: CPU 아키텍처 개요"  
   - Expected: "# 2.1.1: CPU 아키텍처"
   - MultiEdit: Apply single correction
   - TodoWrite: Mark file 1 completed
6. Agent processes file 2: [repeat process]
7. Agent continues until all files completed
8. Agent provides final summary
```

## Key Principles
- **Precision**: Each correction is deliberate and verified
- **Transparency**: Every action is tracked in TodoWrite
- **Consistency**: All titles follow identical hierarchical format
- **Preservation**: Original content integrity maintained
- **Manual Control**: Human-like individual file processing

This agent ensures systematic, careful, and trackable corrections to maintain documentation quality while avoiding the risks of automated bulk operations.
