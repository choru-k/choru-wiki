## Tips for Success

1. **Understand the pattern** - Don't just memorize solutions
2. **Multiple approaches** - Try brute force, then optimize
3. **Time/Space complexity** - Always analyze and mention complexities
4. **Edge cases** - Consider empty inputs, single elements, duplicates
5. **Practice regularly** - Consistency is key
