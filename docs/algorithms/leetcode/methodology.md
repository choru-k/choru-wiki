# LeetCode Study Methodology

## Why Practice LeetCode?

LeetCode serves as an essential tool for:

-**Interview Preparation**: Most tech companies use algorithmic problems in interviews
-**Problem-Solving Skills**: Develops systematic thinking and pattern recognition
-**Code Quality**: Improves ability to write clean, efficient code under constraints
-**Knowledge Reinforcement**: Solidifies understanding of data structures and algorithms

## Essential Algorithms & Data Structures

### Foundation (Must-Know)

#### Sorting & Searching

-**Merge Sort**- Divide and Conquer paradigm
-**Quick Sort**- In-place sorting, partition logic
-**Binary Search**- Logarithmic search in sorted arrays

#### Graph Traversal

-**BFS (Breadth-First Search)**- Level-order traversal, shortest path
-**DFS (Depth-First Search)**- Recursion, backtracking

#### Dynamic Programming

- Essential for optimization problems
- Appears in almost every technical interview
- Focus on state definition and transition

#### Tree Traversal

-**Inorder**- Left → Root → Right
-**Preorder**- Root → Left → Right  
-**Postorder**- Left → Right → Root
-**Level-order**- BFS on trees

#### Advanced Structures

-**Trie**- Prefix trees for string problems
-**Heap/Priority Queue**- For k-th element problems
-**Self-Balanced Trees**- Understand concepts (Red-Black, AVL)

- Implementation rarely required
- Know when to use TreeMap/TreeSet

### Advanced Topics

-**KMP Algorithm**- String pattern matching
-**Union-Find**- Disjoint set operations
-**Topological Sort**- DAG ordering
-**Segment Tree**- Range queries and updates
-**Monotonic Stack/Queue**- For next greater/smaller element problems

## Memory & Complexity Estimation

### Quick Memory Calculations

-**1 billion integers = 4GB**(int is 4 bytes)

- If problem mentions "2 billion integers in 4GB memory" → Use compression/streaming
- HashMap overhead: ~2x the data size
- Even at 90% capacity, HashMap operations remain O(1) average

### Time Complexity Targets

- n ≤ 10^6 → O(n) or O(n log n)
- n ≤ 10^5 → O(n²) might work
- n ≤ 10^3 → O(n³) is feasible
- n ≤ 20 → O(2^n) exponential solutions

## Study Strategy

### 1. Problem Selection

- Start with problems tagged with concepts you're learning
- Progress: Easy (30%) → Medium (60%) → Hard (10%)
- Focus on frequently asked problems by target companies

### 2. Problem-Solving Approach

#### Step 1: Understand (5 minutes)

- Read carefully, identify constraints
- Clarify ambiguities
- Think about edge cases

#### Step 2: Approach (10 minutes)

- Start with brute force
- Identify patterns and optimizations
- Consider multiple approaches

#### Step 3: Code (20 minutes)

- Implement cleanest solution first
- Then optimize if needed

#### Step 4: Review (10 minutes)

- Trace through test cases
- Analyze time/space complexity
- Consider alternative solutions

### 3. Learning from Solutions

**Most Important**: Review is more valuable than solving

- Problems solved correctly on first try: Skip review
- Problems requiring hints/multiple attempts:**Must review**

Focus on:

-**Why**this approach works
-**How**to recognize similar patterns
-**When**to apply this technique

### 4. Retention Strategy

#### Active Recall

- Explain solutions aloud as if teaching
- Write explanations in your own words
- This is why writing these notes helps!

#### Spaced Repetition

- Review after: 1 day → 3 days → 1 week → 2 weeks → 1 month
- Focus on problems you struggled with

#### Pattern Recognition

- Group similar problems together
- Identify common techniques
- Build a mental pattern library

## Interview Performance Tips

### Communication

-**Think aloud**- Verbalize your thought process
-**Ask questions**- Clarify requirements
-**Discuss trade-offs**- Show you understand complexity

### Problem Approach

1.**Clarify**- Understand the problem completely
2.**Examples**- Work through simple cases
3.**Brute Force**- Start with naive solution
4.**Optimize**- Improve time/space complexity
5.**Code**- Implement cleanly
6.**Test**- Walk through edge cases

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't jump to coding immediately
- Don't ignore edge cases
- Don't optimize prematurely
- Don't give up if stuck - think aloud

### Study Plans

-**Beginners**: 2-3 problems/day, focus on Easy
-**Intermediate**: 1-2 Medium/day, occasional Hard
-**Interview Prep**: Mock interviews, timed practice

## Success Metrics

Track your progress:

- Problems solved by difficulty
- Success rate on first attempt
- Time to optimal solution
- Pattern recognition speed

Remember:**Quality > Quantity**

- 100 problems with deep understanding > 500 problems memorized
- Focus on patterns, not just solutions
- The goal is problem-solving ability, not problem count
